This app is just a test about KineticJS where I just make fun about colorizing an exported svg ! :)

To install the app you have to install nodejs and npm.

Then,

1. Install grunt : "npm -g install grunt-cli"

2. Developement mode
   Run : "grunt serve"
   
   Production mode :
   Run : "grunt build"
